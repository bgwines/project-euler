{- Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the following properties are true:

S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
If S(A) is minimised for a given n, we shall call it an optimum special sum set. The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.

n = 1: {1}
n = 2: {1, 2}
n = 3: {2, 3, 4}
n = 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}
n = 5: {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}

It seems that for a given optimum set, A = {a1, a2, ... , an}, the next optimum set is of the form B = {b, a1+b, a2+b, ... ,an+b}, where b is the "middle" element on the previous row.

By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for n = 6 to be A = {11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24}, with S(A) = 117. However, this is not the optimum set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a near optimum set. The optimum set for n = 6 is A = {11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25}, with S(A) = 115 and corresponding set string: 111819202225.

Given that A is an optimum special sum set for n = 7, find its set string. -}

-- optimizations:

	-- checking S /= preperty:
		-- only need to check subsets of equal size (by Property 2)
		-- only need to check subset pairs of sizes >=2
		-- 
		-- for now, just check manually
		--     minor optimization: don't take powerset every time (only 2nd half will contain n)

	-- check if monotonic(S, (<)) property is maintained:
			-- only need to compare top 1 against bottom 2, top 2 against bottom 3, etc.
				-- can cache bottom levels

	-- for each x:
		-- can cache top 1 / 2 / 3 from previous iterations
			-- maybe even from previous recursion - n=7 might be too small for this to matter - yeah; just prepend and map ((+) k)
		-- if doesn't satisfy, can abort inner loop early
							-- can abort outer loop early
							-- can abort recursion -- cannot satisfy current list.
