		If t represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that t = 8 is type L(1) and t = 32 is type L(2).

		Let N(n) be the number of t ≤ 1000000 such that t is type L(n); for example, N(15) = 832.

		If t represents the number of tiles used, let L(t) be a function that counts the number of distinct laminae formable with t tiles. For example, we shall say that L(8) = 1 and L(32) = 2.

		Let N(k) be the number of t ≤ 1000000 such that L(t) = k; for example, N(15) = 832.
