I'm putting these up on the internet for a few reasons. For example, it's a way to encourage me to work on my coding style by publishing clean code. If you're interested in the idioms, decomposition, data structures, and optimizations I use, please feel free to peruse my solutions, but keep in mind that if you're planning to solve these yourself, it's more valuable to do it by yourself first, and then see what others have done.

Thanks to [Lucas Garron] (https://github.com/lgarron/project-euler) for the template for this disclaimer.
